# Rationale

Everyone of us wakes up in the morning and go to our respective offices or schools.
The next thing you do not want is a traffic congestion problem that slows you down
the road and making you wait for hours. The researchers need to define first what is
traffic congestion in order to know the problem. <sup>1</sup> Traffic congestion is a
condition on road networks that happen when an increase of vehicle use exceeds its
intended usage. Another definition is <sup>2</sup> the way in which vehicles interact
to impede each other's progress. Now that they have defined traffic congestion. They
know its primary cause and that is the use of vehicles impeding each other in the road.
Traffic congestion itself is not a problem, its effects are the real problem. <sup>2</sup>
Effects caused by traffic congestions are longer journey times, increased queuing at
junctions or bottlenecks, increase in vehicles stopping and starting, more
time spent stationary and less predictable journey times. Traffic congestion's definition,
cause and effect has been mentioned, the next thing to do is where do traffic congestion
happen almost of the time. Cities are likely the places where traffic
congestion occur most of the time. Even large cities suffer from traffic congestion.
On-line sources of cities which are suffering from traffic congestion are the following;
<sup>3</sup> Beijing inbound vehicles are in a queue for about 100 kilometers because
of heavy traffic, they have to wait for 9 days before they can resume normal traffic flow.
<sup>4</sup> Jakarta have the worst traffic in the world according to motor oil company
Castrol. <sup>5</sup> Istanbul is ranked first in the world regarding traffic congestion
with a congestion level of 58% as of July 6, 2015 according to a traffic index website.
The researcher's are situated in the City of Tagbilaran and the City cannot escape what
bigger cities are facing about traffic congestion problem. The researchers have discovered
on-line sources which talks about the traffic congestion in the City. The excerpts are the
following; <sup>6</sup> The City Mayor seeks assistance from the national government to
solve traffic problems in the City, <sup>7</sup> A study has been conducted in the city
and determined the main cause of the traffic problem is the lack or absence of sidewalks
in the streets. Clearly the City is facing a problem that will eventually escalate if ignored.
The is why the researchers have chosen their own city to conduct the research.

The researchers need a effective traffic detection system that will eventually notify people
when a particular street is experiencing traffic congestion. To fully understand what the traffic
detection system will do and how will it work, some technologies are used to aid us in our
research. One of this technologies is called Computer Vision. Computer Vision is simply a
technology that depends heavily on images and converts this images to large arrays of positive integers.
Imagine a matrix, the matrix has a 2 by 2 dimension. Each element in the matrix is a positive integer,
that integer represents the color of that pixel. Images may vary in size or resolution so does the
matrix. The matrix represent only a single image, a video stream consists many images and converts
those images to a matrix one by one. After the conversion from image to matrix, mathematical models
are used to know if there are changes in the current matrix from the previous matrix. This is what
computer vision does. Computer vision will detect moving objects in the images through video cameras.
Computer vision is used as the primary technology used in detecting moving vehicles in the road.
