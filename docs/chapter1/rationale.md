# Rationale

Tagbilaran City is currently experiencing high traffic load during rush
hours. The researchers need a sufficient traffic control system that will keep the
vehicles flowing. The researchers will prototype a capable system that will only
know if a one way street is experiencing high, moderate or low traffic.
If the prototype will show accurate results the researchers will gradually scale
the system to accommodate the most busiest roads in the city. The researchers will
accumulate data for further studies relating to traffic management.
The researchers will apply fuzzy logic algorithm to solve this problem because of its
nature to accept small uncertain inputs and process this inputs to make
reliable results that will eventually solve the traffic issues in the city.
Another reason for this study is the researchers fascination about computer vision.
The large community on computer vision will aid the researchers in prototyping the system.
The researchers is also new on computer vision and fuzzy logic concepts
and wants to improve on these domains for future ventures.
