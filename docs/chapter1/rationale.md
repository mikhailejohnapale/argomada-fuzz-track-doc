# Rationale

Tagbilaran City is currently experiencing high traffic congestion during rush
hours. High traffic congestion happens when roads are highly used by vehicles
that results to slower speeds and vehicle queuing. Traffic congestion directly
affects the city and its residents. Problems like high carbon dioxide emissions
that lead to a more polluted air, accumulated penalties that commuters receive
when they are late in their respective office that results to income deductions,
Unproductive motorists idling, Emergency vehicles cannot respond immediately.
Those are just a few problems encountered during traffic congestion in any other
city. This made the researchers choose this study and help the city authorities
in knowing the traffic congestion problem in Tagbilaran City.

The researchers need a sufficient traffic detection system that will notify
subscribers and the city traffic management to keep the vehicles flowing.
The researchers will prototype a capable system that will only
know if a one way street is experiencing high, moderate or low traffic.
If the prototype will show accurate results the researchers will gradually scale
the system to accommodate the most busiest roads in the city. The researchers will
accumulate data for further studies relating to traffic management.
Another reason for this study is the researchers fascination about computer vision.
The large community on computer vision will aid the researchers in prototyping the system.
The researchers is also new on computer vision and fuzzy logic concepts
and wants to improve on these domains for future ventures.

The researchers will apply fuzzy logic algorithm to solve this problem because of its
nature to accept small uncertain inputs and process this inputs to make
reliable results that will eventually solve the traffic issues in the city.
Another reason for choosing fuzzy logic algorithm is its wide use in traffic
engineering in traffic systems.
