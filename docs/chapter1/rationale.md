# Rationale

Traffic congestion is a very common problem mostly experienced in cities. <sup>1</sup>
By definition, it is a condition on road networks that happen when an increase of vehicle use exceeds its
intended usage. <sup>2</sup> In Beijing inbound vehicles are in a queue for about 100 kilometers because
of heavy traffic and they have to wait for nine days before they can resume normal traffic flow.
<sup>3</sup> Jakarta have the worst traffic in the world according to motor oil company
Castrol. <sup>4</sup> Istanbul is ranked first in the world regarding traffic congestion
with a congestion level of 58% as of July 6, 2015 according to a traffic index website tomtom.com.
In the Philippines, the worst traffic is experienced in Metro Manila, being the center of commerce
and industry. Traffic congestion does not excuse small cities like Tagbilaran City, Bohol. This is
evidenced by <sup>5</sup> the City Mayor seeking assistance from the national government to
solve traffic problems in the City, this prompted the researchers to dwell more on the traffic
congestion problem.

With the advent of technology used to solve problems and issues, computer vision is a common
technology used in traffic situations. It is used in detecting moving vehicles in the road,
collecting vehicle count, density and processing results. Using this concept, a system will be 
developed and results will be processed using the fuzzy logic algorithm. <sup>6</sup> Fuzzy 
logic algorithm by definition is an approach to computing based on `degrees of truth`.
Fuzzy logic implementation is very common on various traffic control systems. The said algorithm
will determine a traffic situation from the results passed on after implementing computer vision.

Since traffic congestion happens when there's an increase of vehicles use exceeding the roads
intended usage, there must be a mechanism of informing mobile vehicle drivers to avoid such
road, so as not to congest it. Thus, the proposed traffic congestion notification system. It
is the integration of computer vision with fuzz logic and SMS technology. A registered user
will be notified through a text message about traffic conditions in the city. This will allow the 
people present in the city or people who are inbound the city to avoid a particular road
experiencing traffic congestion. This will improve the city's driving experience and avoid 
traffic congestions in the future.

The main reason of doing this project despite the presence of other systems is the need of it in Tagbilaran
City. Data today is very indispensable, traffic data is stagnant because of manual observations not primarily
used in quantification. This data accumulated will eventually be very important for traffic engineers or
researchers who want to study the traffic situation in the city. If they have the data to study, they can
simulate traffic in a recorded date and observe the behavior.
