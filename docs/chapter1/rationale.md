# Rationale

Everyone of us wakes up in the morning and go to our respective offices or schools.
The next thing you do not want is a traffic congestion problem that slows you down
the road and making you wait for hours. The researchers need to define first what is
traffic congestion in order to know the problem. <sup>1</sup> Traffic congestion is a
condition on road networks that happen when an increase of vehicle use exceeds it
intended usage. Another definition is <sup>2</sup> the way in which vehicles interact
to impede each other's progress. Now that they have defined traffic congestion. They
know its primary cause and that is the use of vehicles impeding each other in the road.
Traffic congestion itself is not a problem, its effects is the real problem. <sup>2</sup>
Effects caused by traffic congestions are longer journey times, increased queueing at
junctions or bottlenecks, increase in vehicles stopping and starting all the time, more
time spent stationary and less predictable journey times. Traffic congestion's definition,
cause and effect has been mentioned, the next thing to do is where do traffic congestion
happen almost of the time. Cities are likely the places where traffic
congestion occur most of the time. Even large cities suffer from traffic congestion.
Online sources of cities which are suffering from traffic congestion are the following;
<sup>3</sup> Beijing inbound vehicles are in a queue for about 100 kilometers because
of heavy traffic, they have to wait for 9 days before they can resume normal traffic flow.
<sup>4</sup> Jakarta have the worst traffic in the world according to motor oil company
Castrol. <sup>5</sup> Istanbul is ranked first in the world regarding traffic congestion
with a congestion level of 58% as of July 6, 2015 according to a traffic index website.
