# Objectives of the study

This study aims to provide a solution to traffic congestion by notifying public and private drivers about the traffic status of a particular street in Tagbilaran City through SMS. The concepts of image processing and fuzzy  logic is introduced to develop the solution. Image processing is used to identify all traffic entities in a one way road,then  the data collected will be synthesized and analyzed by using fuzzy logic algorithms. Below are the specific objectives to be performed in our study.

1. Develop a program or  prototype that will detect all traffic entities.
2. Implement  a fuzzy logic algorithm that will determine the traffic status.
3. Develop a program that will be used to  deliver the output of the program.
4. If possible the study will be scaled by using multi-lanes traffic detection.
