# Objectives of the study

This study aims to provide a solution to traffic congestion by notifying its users
about the traffic status of a particular road in Tagbilaran City through SMS (Short Message Service)
or the system's website. The concepts of image processing and fuzzy  logic is introduced
to develop the solution. Image processing is used to identify objects moving in a one way road,
then the data collected will be synthesized and analyzed by using fuzzy logic algorithm if
that road is experiencing high, moderate or low traffic.

Below are the specific objectives to be performed in our study.

1. Develop a system or prototype that will detect all objects in the road.
2. Implement fuzzy logic algorithm that will determine the traffic status.
3. Develop system that will be used to deliver the output of its process.
4. If possible the study will be scaled by probing multi-laned roads to detect traffic congestion.
