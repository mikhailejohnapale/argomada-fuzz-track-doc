# Objectives of the study

This study aims to provide a solution to traffic 
congestion by developing a Traffic congestion notification 
system with the use of image processing concepts,fuzzy algorithm and SMS technology.

The specific objectives of the study are:

1. Create a system  using image processing to detect cars in the road.
2. Implement the fuzzy logic algorithm to determine a high,moderate or 
low traffic to no traffic at all.
3. Develop a notification system to deliver the output of the fuzzy algorithm to the subscribers.
