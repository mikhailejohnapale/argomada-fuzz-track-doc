# Scope and Limitations of the Study

**Scope**

The study is based in implementing fuzzy logic
that is mostly used in traffic control systems. The
researchers will create a program that would detect vehicles
using OpenCV (Open Computer Vision). The researchers will
use convergence of tools and Python as the main programming language
to construct the system. The system would detect if the one way road has heavy,
moderate or low traffic congestion of vehicles and notify its subscribers.


**Limitations**

The study will only focus on a one way road. The video sensor
must be strategically placed in a position where the vehicles
will pass through with out overlapping each other because we
are using background subtraction as the main detection technique
using OpenCV. The system cannot provide live video streams
of the road because it has limited bandwidth for uploading huge
streams of data.
