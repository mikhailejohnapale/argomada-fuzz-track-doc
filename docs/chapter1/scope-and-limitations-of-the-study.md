Scope and Limitations

Scope :

The study uses the Fuzzy Logic as its structure
 to determine if the lane is traffic or not, in 
 this study the program would detect vehicles 
 namely cars, motorcycles, vans, cabs and buses 
 on a single one way road.


Limitations :

The study will only focus only vehicles traveling 
in a one way lane since it's beyond the researchers 
capability to cover a two way lane and especially 
roads that have intersections. The devices used to
 process the data in the program are only limited 
 to researchers resources.
