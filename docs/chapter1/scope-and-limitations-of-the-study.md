# Scope and Limitations of the Study

**Scope**

The study uses the fuzzy logic as its structure that is mostly 
used in traffic control systems. The researchers, using OpenCV 
(Open Computer Vision), to detect incoming vehicles on a one 
way road. The system would detect if the one way road has a heavy, 
moderate or low traffic congestion of vehicles and notifying to its 
subscribers.


**Limitations**

The study could only focus on a one way road. The video sensors
must be strategically placed in a position in which the vehicles 
seen must not be overlapping with each other due to the researchers 
using background subtraction as the main image processing technique 
through OpenCV. The system cannot provide live video streams of 
the road because of its limited bandwidth for uploading huge 
streams of data.
