# Scope and Limitations

Scope :
    
The study is based on the implementation of the fuzzy 
logic that is mostly used in motion detection, in this 
study the program would only detect vehicles namely 
cars, motorcycles, vans, cabs and buses in only on a 
one lane road. Using Python as the programming language 
to construct the program. The program would detect if 
the lane has a heavy congestion of vehicles and send 
an SMS text to subscribers.


Limitations :

The study will only focus on a one lane that vehicles 
would always pass through, the study can't cover a 
road that has two lanes and especially roads that are 
intersection, and the devices used in the program to 
process the data is only limited to the researches devices.
