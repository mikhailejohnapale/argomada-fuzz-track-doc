# Scope and Limitations of the Study

**Scope**

The study uses the fuzzy logic as its structure that is 
mostly used in traffic control systems. The researchers 
conducted a study using OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) to 
detect incoming vehicles on a one way road by implementing 
the concept of fuzzy logic. Gathered data from the City 
Government and T.a.R.S.I.E.R 117 (Telephone and Radio System 
Integrated Emergency Response 117) from the City of Tagbilaran, 
Bohol Province. The system would detect if the one way road 
has a heavy, moderate or low traffic congestion of vehicles 
and notify the result of the system to its subscribers. The 
system is a web based and standalone. The system could only 
provide already collected video feeds and not live stream.

**Limitations**

The study could only focus on a one way road. The researchers 
could not provide live video streams of the road due to limited 
bandwidth for uploading huge streams of data.
