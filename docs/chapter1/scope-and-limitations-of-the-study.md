# Scope and Limitations of the Study

The main goal of the study is the development of a traffic 
congestion notification system. It will make use of computer 
vision concepts, results of which will be fed into the fuzzy 
logic algorithm, which will determine whether there's no 
traffic, there's low traffic, there's moderate traffic, or 
there's heavy traffic. These results will be delivered to 
registered subscribers through SMS technology. A website of 
the system is available on the internet for users  to 
subscribe, and keeps updated on the traffic.


Traffic data that will be used to feed the system will 
come from the City Government of Tagbilaran City and 
T.a.R.S.I.E.R 117. This means, video feeds are used as 
sample inputs and not live stream video of traffic. 
Furthurmore, only one way roads will be covered.
