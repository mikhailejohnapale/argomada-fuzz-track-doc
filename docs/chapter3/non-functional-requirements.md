Nature of the System:

Traffic Congestion Detection and Notification System is an application
that will detect traffic status of a single lane road.
The fuzzy logic algorithm will be tested during the
development and production process to determine its efficiency
in detecting traffic congestion through human observation comparison
from the systems asserted road status.
