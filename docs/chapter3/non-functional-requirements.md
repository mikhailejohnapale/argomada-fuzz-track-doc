# Non-Fucnctional Requirements

The researchers have defined the following non-functional requirements
that is needed in both the development and deployment of the proposed
system. These specifications are identified through rigid research and
testing.

DEPLOYMENT
| Processor     | 4th Generation Intel Core i3-4030U (1.90GHz 1600MHz 3MB) |
| Disk Space    | 20 GB                                                    |
| RAM Size (GB) | 1GB DDR3                                                 |

DEVELOPMENT
| Operating System | Ubuntu Desktop 14.04.2 LTS (Trusty Tahr) x64             |
| Processor        | 4th Generation Intel Core i3-4030U (1.90GHz 1600MHz 3MB) |
| RAM Size (GB)    | 16GB PC3-12800 DDR3L SDRAM 1600 MHz                      |
| Disk Space       | 512 GB                                                   |

Nature of the System:
Traffic Congestion Notification System is an online application
deployed on virtual private servers offered by private hosting
companies or you can build your own private servers and deploy
the system. The fuzzy logic algorithm will be tested during the
development and production process to determine its effeciency
in detecting traffic congestion.
