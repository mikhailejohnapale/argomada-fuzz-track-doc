Nature of the System:

Traffic Congestion Detection and Notification System is an application
that will detect traffic status of a single lane road. The application is a
standalone system that will accept a video file of a single lane road and sends
SMS messages to registered users. The registered users are from an auxiliary online
application. The auxiliary online application is a website that will let users register
and know road traffic status in realtime.
