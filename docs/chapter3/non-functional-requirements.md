# Non-Functional Requirements

The researchers have defined the following non-functional requirements
that is needed in both the development and deployment of the proposed
system. These specifications are identified through rigid research and
testing.

Nature of the System:
Traffic Congestion Notification System is an online application
deployed on virtual private servers offered by private hosting
companies or you can build your own private servers and deploy
the system. The fuzzy logic algorithm will be tested during the
development and production process to determine its efficiency
in detecting traffic congestion.
