Tagbilaran city's traffic congestion problem is getting worser each year. There are many attempted
solutions regarding the problem but none of them worked. The researchers investigated the current
traffic situation of the city and learned the following; The traffic lights in the city is not
controlled by a central server therefore any kind of automated traffic rerouting is not possible.
The traffic lights does not show autonomous characteristics during its operation. The city itself
is growing and banks are popping out fast, meaning more money is flowing in the city. Car dealers
can be observed along Carlos P. Garcia North Avenue and these companies know their target markets.
This simple observation leads to increase in car ownership.
Accidents happen a lot, a road where the accident happened will cause traffic congestion within
seconds. [Recio](http://www.tagbilaran.gov.ph/news/mayor-yap-seeks-mmdas-assistance/) (2015) said
that the roads in here are narrow and also accommodates parking.
[Tirol](http://boholchronicle.com.ph/2015/04/05/without-sidewalks-we-cannot-solve-the-traffic-problem/) (2015)
concluded in his study that the main cause of the traffic problem is the lack or absence of sidewalks in the
streets. It causes obstructions to traffic flow. Other studies shows the following causes about traffic congestion;
Rodrique et al, (2009) states that lack of transport facilities like road space, parking area, road signals
and effective traffic management. Downie (2008) stated that traffic congestion happens when the volume of
vehicular traffic is greater than the available road capacity, known also as saturation.
These are just a few traffic problems in Tagbilaran City.

Effects of Traffic congestion are the following; Motorists will lack parking spaces near the city center.
Employees will lose income if they are late in their respective offices because of salary deductions.
May and Marsden (2007) argue that congestion causes disruption on business activities in cities and
reduces productivity. This affects a wide range activities, services, goods, markets opportunities in the
cities which can best be delivered through transport mobility. Weisbrod et al. (2003) asserts by saying
that increased traffic congestion imposes cost upon commuters and affect business operations. It increases
business cost on its operations relying on vehicular mobility. Lewis (2008) and Downie, (2008) describes that
industries that adopt just-in-time production, distribution and inventory management system will suffer to
attain reliable just-in-time deliveries for enhanced productivity and competitiveness.

Computer vision is used in a variety of ways. One usage of computer vision is using public CCTV cameras
to observe and quantify objects seen by it. This CCTV cameras will act as traffic status sensors or vehicle
counting devices to help traffic authorities gather data and impose traffic solutions minimizing traffic
congestions. Aliakhmet & Zharkynbek (2008) used OpenCV to make a vision based traffic control system. It
is based on vehicle flow estimation. They used  OpenCV libraries to conduct traffic surveillance. The procedure
in performing the vehicle detection are the following; 1) Perform background subtraction, 2) Obtain binary images
without noises, 3) Detect the extracted white pixels, 4) Establish a contour of the object, 5) Compare the results
of blob and contour detection, 6) Select objects that satisfy both conditions, 7) Introduce reference lines on the road,
8) Count the objects that cross the line, 9) Display the results.
